## My process
I used Bootstrap to start with a pre-defined grid system from the get go and the time it took to develop was reduced from almost 2 days for my previous project in pure CSS to almost 3 or 4 hours. This component was made with mobile first approach and scaled to match desktop devices.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Bootstrap

### What I learned

- Bootstrap libraries potential to reduce development time
- Animation transitions and hover effects

### Continued development

To optimize the css styles I use and next step would be to acheive this with SCSS or Sass preprocessing framework
