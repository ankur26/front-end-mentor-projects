## My process

I started with building the component from a desktop workflow and initially and quickly realized and faced problems while trying to switch over to mobile devices so I had to start from scratch and focused on mobile first development. The component card has been made with pure CSS and semantic HTML, no frameworks used. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

- Flexbox
- Responsive Media Queries
- Mobile First Approach as the card component was designed with mobile devices in mind
