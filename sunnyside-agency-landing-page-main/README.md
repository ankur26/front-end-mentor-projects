## My process/challenges

I used this project to refresh on my HTML and CSS skills. Making a hamburger layout manually presented it's own set of challenges such as working out the padding and dimensions for the layout so it does not bounce around when the button is clicked. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- DOM manipulation

### What I learned/refreshed upon

- Flexbox
- Responsive Media Queries
- Mobile First Approach
- DOM manipulation using JS.
