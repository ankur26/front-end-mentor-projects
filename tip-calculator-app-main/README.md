## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Calculate the correct tip and total cost of the bill per person

## My process

Initially started with getting the mobile design right and got pretty close to what was seen in the screenshot images provided in the design starter kit by FrontEndMentor. Once done I got the Javascript Interactivity working, I then went on to fix the desktop layout for larger screens. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Javascript( DOM interaction )

### What I learned

Form inputs are very hard to style and interact with especially when it comes to CSS and DOM manipulation using JS. I have been having issues where things like the bill amount should not be adding numbers but if you place the keyboard cursor at another position it will allow characters which potentially breaks the code.

### Continued development

More fixes coming on the JS side, such as cursor placing for inputs and dynamic text sizing for larger values to fit in as the user enters a very large number to split the tip for. Another addition is for form elements which are left empty, while I have currently made a workaround where the form just shows 0 as the tip amount if there are invalid entries, it still warrants a fix as the design files do mention that to be added.
